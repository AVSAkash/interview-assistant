### **Core Features**

- **Resume Parsing:** Upload a PDF or DOCX resume to automatically extract the candidate's **Name**, **Email**, and **Phone Number**.
- **Interactive Chatbot:** If any details are missing, a friendly chatbot will collect them before the interview begins.
- **Dynamic AI Interview:** A timed, 6-question interview (2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard) with questions dynamically generated by a powerful AI model for a Full Stack (React/Node) role.
- **Timed Questions:** Each question difficulty has a specific timer (Easy: 20s, Medium: 60s, Hard: 120s). The system auto-submits when time runs out.
- **Automated Evaluation:** Each answer is judged by the AI, which provides a **score** and **feedback**. At the end, it generates a final score and a concise performance **summary**.
- **Comprehensive Dashboard:** The "Interviewer" tab features a dashboard with a list of all candidates, sortable by score.
- **Detailed View:** Click on any candidate to see their profile, a full transcript of the interview (all questions, answers, and scores), and the final AI summary.
- **Data Persistence:** All application state is saved to local storage. You can close or refresh the browser and resume an interview exactly where you left off, greeted by a "Welcome Back!" modal.
- **Responsive UI:** A clean, modern, and responsive interface built with Ant Design.
